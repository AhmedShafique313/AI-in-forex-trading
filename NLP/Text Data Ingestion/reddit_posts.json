        "description": "Hi guys,\n\nI have been using reddit for years in my personal life (not trading!) and wanted to give something back in an area where i am an expert.\n\nI worked at an investment bank for seven years and joined them as a graduate FX trader so  have lots of professional experience, by which i mean I was trained and paid by a big institution  to trade on their behalf. This is very different to being a full-time home trader, although that is not to discredit those guys, who can accumulate a good amount of experience/wisdom through self learning.\n\nWhen I get time I'm going to write a mid-length posts on each topic for you guys along the lines of how i was trained. I guess there would be 15-20 topics in total so about 50-60 posts. Feel free to comment or ask questions.\n\n**The first topic is Risk Management and we'll cover it in three parts**\n\n**Part I**\n\n* Why it matters\n* Position sizing\n* Kelly\n* Using stops sensibly\n* Picking a clear level\n\n# Why it matters\n\nThe first rule of making money through trading is to ensure you do not **lose** money. Look at any serious hedge fund\u2019s website and they\u2019ll talk about their first priority being \u201cpreservation of investor capital.\u201d\u00a0\n\nYou have to keep it before you grow it.\n\nStrangely, if you look at retail trading websites, for every one article on risk management there are probably fifty on trade selection. This is completely the wrong way around.\n\nThe great news is that this stuff is pretty simple and process-driven. Anyone can learn and follow best practices.\n\nSeriously, avoiding mistakes is one of the most important things: there's not some holy grail system for finding winning trades, rather a routine and fairly boring set of processes that ensure that you are profitable, despite having plenty of  losing trades alongside the winners.\n\n# Capital and position sizing\n\nThe first thing you have to know is how much capital you are working with. Let\u2019s say you have $100,000 deposited. This is your maximum trading capital. Your trading capital is not the leveraged amount. It is the amount of money you have deposited and can withdraw or lose.\n\nPosition sizing is what ensures that a losing streak does not take you out of the market.\n\nA rule of thumb is that one should risk no more than 2% of one\u2019s account balance on an individual trade and no more than 8% of one\u2019s account balance on a specific theme. We\u2019ll look at why that\u2019s a rule of thumb later. For now let\u2019s just accept those numbers and look at examples.\n\nSo we have $100,000 in our account. And we wish to buy EURUSD. We should therefore not be risking more than 2% which $2,000.\u00a0\n\nWe look at a technical chart and decide to leave a stop below the monthly low, which is 55 pips below market. We\u2019ll come back to this in a bit. So what should our position size be?\u00a0\n\nWe go to the calculator page, select Position Size and enter our details. There are many such calculators online -  just google \"Pip calculator\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y38zb666e5h51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26e4fe569dc5c1f43ce4c746230c49b138691d14\n\nSo the appropriate size is a buy position of 363,636 EURUSD. If it reaches our stop level we know we\u2019ll lose precisely $2,000 or 2% of our capital.\u00a0\n\nYou should be using this calculator (or something similar) on every single trade so that you know your risk.\n\nNow imagine that we have similar bets on EURJPY and EURGBP, which have also broken above moving averages. Clearly this EUR-momentum is a theme. If it works all three bets are likely to pay off. But if it goes wrong we are likely to lose on all three at once. We are going to look at this concept of correlation in more detail later.\n\nThe total amount of risk in our portfolio - if all of the trades on this EUR-momentum theme were to hit their stops - should not exceed $8,000 or 8% of total capital. This allows us to go big on themes we like without going bust when the theme does not work.\u00a0\n\nAs we\u2019ll see later, many traders only win on 40-60% of trades. So you have to accept losing trades will be common and ensure you size trades so they cannot ruin you.\n\nSimilarly, like poker players, we should risk more on trades we feel confident about and less on trades that seem less compelling. However, this should always be subject to overall position sizing constraints.\n\nFor example before you put on each trade you might rate the strength of your conviction in the trade and allocate a position size accordingly:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2ea6rgae5h51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=4332cb8d0bbbc3d8db972c1f28e8189105393e5b\n\nTo keep yourself disciplined you should try to ensure that no more than one in twenty trades are graded exceptional and allocated 5% of account balance risk. It really should be a rare moment when all the stars align for you.\u00a0\n\nNotice that the nice thing about dealing in percentages is that it scales. Say you start out with $100,000 but end the year up 50% at $150,000. Now a 1% bet will risk $1,500 rather than $1,000. That makes sense as your capital has grown.\n\nIt is extremely common for retail accounts to blow-up by making only 4-5 losing trades because they are leveraged at 50:1 and have taken on far too large a position, relative to their account balance.\u00a0\n\nConsider that GBPUSD tends to move 1% each day. If you have an account balance of $10k then it would be crazy to take a position of $500k (50:1 leveraged). A 1% move on $500k is $5k.\u00a0\n\nTwo perfectly regular down days in a row \u2014 or a single day\u2019s move of 2% \u2014 and you will receive a margin call from the broker, have the account closed out, and have lost all your money.\u00a0\n\nDo not let this happen to you. Use position sizing discipline to protect yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kelly Criterion\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering - why \u201cabout 2%\u201d per trade? - that\u2019s a fair question. Why not 0.5% or 10% or any other number?\n\nThe Kelly Criterion is a formula that was adapted for use in casinos. If you know the odds of winning and the expected pay-off, it tells you how much you should bet in each round.\n\nThis is harder than it sounds. Let\u2019s say you could bet on a weighted coin flip, where it lands on heads 60% of the time and tails 40% of the time. The payout is $2 per $1 bet.\n\nWell, absolutely you should bet. The odds are in your favour. But if you have, say, $100 it is less obvious how much you should bet to avoid ruin.\u00a0\n\nSay you bet $50, the odds that it could land on tails twice in a row are 16%. You could easily be out after the first two flips.\u00a0\n\nEqually, betting $1 is not going to maximise your advantage. The odds are 60/40 in your favour so only betting $1 is likely too conservative. The Kelly Criterion is a formula that produces the long-run optimal bet size, given the odds.\n\nApplying the formula to forex trading looks like this:\n\n*Position size % = Winning trade % - ( (1- Winning trade %) / Risk-reward ratio*\n\nIf you have recorded hundreds of trades in your journal - see next chapter - you can calculate what this outputs for you specifically.\n\nIf you don't have hundreds of trades then let\u2019s assume some realistic defaults of **Winning trade %** being 30% and **Risk-reward ratio** being 3. The 3 implies your TP is 3x the distance of your stop from entry e.g. 300 pips take profit and 100 pips stop loss.\n\nSo that\u2019s\u00a0 0.3 - (1 - 0.3) / 3 = 6.6%.\n\nHold on a second. 6.6% of your account probably feels like a LOT to risk per trade.This is the main observation people have on Kelly: whilst it may optimise the long-run results it doesn\u2019t take into account the pain of drawdowns. It is better thought of as the rational maximum limit. You needn\u2019t go right up to the limit!\n\nWith a 30% winning trade ratio, the odds of you losing on four trades in a row is nearly one in four. That would result in a drawdown of nearly a quarter of your starting account balance. Could you really stomach that and put on the fifth trade, cool as ice?\u00a0Most of us could not.\n\nAccordingly people tend to reduce the bet size. For example, let\u2019s say you know you would feel emotionally affected by losing 25% of your account.\n\nWell, the simplest way is to divide the Kelly output by four. You have effectively hidden 75% of your account balance from Kelly and it is now optimised to avoid a total wipeout of just the 25% it can see.\n\nThis gives 6.6% / 4 = 1.65%. Of course different trading approaches and different risk appetites will provide different optimal bet sizes but as a rule of thumb something between 1-2% is appropriate for the style and risk appetite of most retail traders.\n\nIncidentally be very wary of systems or traders who claim high winning trade % like 80%. Invariably these don\u2019t pass a basic sense-check:\n\n* How many live trades have you done? *Often they\u2019ll have done only a handful of real trades and the rest are simulated backtests, which are overfitted. The model will soon die.*\u00a0\n* What is your risk-reward ratio on each trade? *If you have a take profit $3 away and a stop loss $100 away, of course most trades will be winners. You will not be making money, however!*\u00a0In general most traders should trade smaller position sizes and less frequently than they do. If you are going to bias one way or the other, far better to start off too small.\n\n# How to use stop losses sensibly\n\nStop losses have a bad reputation amongst the retail community but are absolutely essential to risk management. No serious discretionary trader can operate without them.\u00a0\n\nA stop loss is a resting order, left with the broker, to automatically close your position if it reaches a certain price. For a recap on the various order types visit this chapter.\n\nThe valid concern with stop losses is that disreputable brokers look for a concentration of stops and then, when the market is close, whipsaw the price through the stop levels so that the clients \u2018stop out\u2019 and sell to the broker at a low rate before the market naturally comes back higher. This is referred to as \u2018stop hunting\u2019.\n\nThis would be extremely immoral behaviour and the way to guard against it is to use a highly reputable top-tier broker in a well regulated region such as the UK.\n\nWhy are stop losses so important? Well, there is no other way to manage risk with certainty.\n\nYou should always have a pre-determined stop loss before you put on a trade. Not having one is a recipe for disaster: you will find yourself emotionally attached to the trade as it goes against you and it will be extremely hard to cut the loss. This is a well known behavioural bias that we\u2019ll explore in a later chapter.\n\nLearning to take a loss and move on rationally is a key lesson for new traders.\n\n*A common mistake is to think of the market as a personal nemesis. The market, of course, is totally impersonal; it doesn\u2019t care whether you make money or not.*\n\n*Bruce Kovner, founder of the hedge fund Caxton Associates*\n\nThere is an old saying amongst bank traders which is \u201closers average losers\u201d.\n\nIt is tempting, having bought EURUSD and seeing it go lower, to buy more. Your average price will improve if you keep buying as it goes lower. If it was cheap before it *must* be a bargain now, right? Wrong.\n\nWhere does that end? Always have a pre-determined cut-off point which limits your risk. A level where you know the reason for the trade was proved \u2018wrong\u2019 ... and stick to it strictly. If you trade using discretion, use stops.\n\n# Picking a  clear  level\n\nWhere you leave your stop loss is key.\u00a0\n\nTypically traders will leave them at big technical levels such as recent highs or lows. For example if EURUSD is trading at 1.1250 and the recent month\u2019s low is 1.1205 then leaving it just below at 1.1200 seems sensible.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you were going long, just below the double bottom support zone seems like a sensible area to leave a stop](https://preview.redd.it/y7cs0cn1f5h51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=81639093b28c5ed778f293f6ab47c25c7aa7d139)\n\nYou want to give it a bit of breathing room as we know support zones often get challenged before the price rallies. This is because lots of traders identify the same zones. You won\u2019t be the only one selling around 1.1200.\u00a0\n\nThe \u201cweak hands\u201d who leave their sell stop order at exactly the level are likely to get taken out as the market tests the support. Those who leave it ten or fifteen pips below the level have more breathing room and will survive a quick test of the level before a resumed run-up.\n\nYour timeframe and trading style clearly play a part. Here\u2019s a candlestick chart (one candle is one day) for GBPUSD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/moyngdy4f5h51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=91af88da00dd3a09e202880d8029b0ddf04fb802\n\nIf you are putting on a trend-following trade you expect to hold for weeks then you need to have a stop loss that can withstand the daily noise. Look at the downtrend on the chart. There were plenty of days in which the price rallied 60 pips or more during the wider downtrend.\u00a0\n\nSo having a really tight stop of, say, 25 pips that gets chopped up in noisy short-term moves is not going to work for this kind of trade. You need to use a wider stop and take a smaller position size, determined by the stop level.\n\nThere are several tools you can use to help you estimate what is a safe distance and we\u2019ll look at those in the next section.\n\nThere are of course exceptions. For example, if you are doing range-break style trading you might have a really tight stop, set just below the previous range high.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygy0tko7f5h51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=34af49da61c911befdc0db26af66f6c313556c81\n\nClearly then where you set stops will depend on your trading style as well as your holding horizons and the volatility of each instrument.\u00a0\n\nHere are some guidelines that can help:\n\n1. Use technical analysis to pick important levels (support, resistance, previous high/lows, moving averages etc.) as these provide clear exit and entry points on a trade.\n2. Ensure that the stop gives your trade enough room to breathe and reflects your timeframe and typical volatility of each pair. See next section.\n3. Always pick your stop level first. Then use a calculator to determine the appropriate lot size for the position, based on the % of your account balance you wish to risk on the trade.\n\nSo far we have talked about price-based stops. There is another sort which is more of a fundamental stop, used alongside - not instead of - price stops. If either breaks you\u2019re out.\n\nFor example if you stop understanding why a product is going up or down and your fundamental thesis has been confirmed wrong, get out. For example, if you are long because you think the central bank is turning hawkish and AUDUSD is going to play catch up with rates \u2026 then you hear dovish noises from the central bank and the bond yields retrace lower and back in line with the currency - close your AUDUSD position. You already know your thesis was wrong. No need to give away more money to the market.\n\n# Coming up in part  II\n\n[EDIT: part II here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ibd24i/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_risk_management/)\n\nLetting stops breathe\n\nWhen to change a stop\n\nEntering and  exiting  winning positions\n\nRisk:reward ratios\n\nRisk-adjusted returns\n\n# Coming up in part  III\n\nSqueezes and  other  risks\n\nMarket positioning\n\nBet correlation\n\nCrap trades, timeouts and monthly limits\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Disclaimer:This content is not investment advice and you should not place any reliance on it.

The market doesnt give a rats about that.\n\nIf you have a particular setup you are willing to risk a ridiculous amount on (ie 5%), then you should only be trading that setup and not the others.\n\nIf an ideology I see floating around the subreddit way too much and it just boils down to traders thinking they know wtf the market is upto. You dont, dont pretend you do, risk your 1% or lower and take the best entries you can. Not 3 different ones where you risk different amounts per entry.\n\nOur job here is to control risk. I dont see why someone would open themselves upto potentially winning 3 x 1% trades and losing 1 x 5% trade to wipe out all their gains because they have more 'conviction' on 1 relative to the other 3. I mean you can argue that and say that you lose 3 x 1% and win the 1 x 5%, but again... our job is to manage risk, not hope for wins.\n\nThe concept, and why its popular, boggles the mind tbh.",

        "description": "Firstly, thanks for the overwhelming comments and feedback. Genuinely really appreciated. I am pleased 500+ of you find it useful.\n\nIf you didn't read the first post you can do so here: [risk management part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ia5f37/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_some_thoughts/). You'll need to do so in order to make sense of the topic.\n\nAs ever please comment/reply below with questions or feedback and I'll do my best to get back to you.\n\n**Part II**\n\n* Letting stops breathe\n* When to change a stop\n* Entering and exiting winning positions\n* Risk:reward ratios\n* Risk-adjusted returns\n\n# Letting stops breathe\n\nWe talked earlier about giving a position enough room to breathe so it is not stopped out in day-to-day noise.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the chart below and imagine you had a trailing stop. It would be super painful to miss out on the wider move just because you left a stop that was too tight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Imagine being long and stopped out on a meaningless retracement ... ouch!](https://preview.redd.it/7eiqkd39zjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efd6d24cc8a43c5a4679261313f6e40a8f7bed4)\n\nOne simple technique is simply to look at your chosen chart - let\u2019s say daily bars. And then look at previous trends and use the measuring tool. Those generally look something like this and then you just click and drag to measure.\n\nFor example if we wanted to bet on a downtrend on the chart above we might look at the biggest retracement on the previous uptrend. That max drawdown was about 100 pips or just under 1%. So you\u2019d want your stop to be able to withstand at least that.\u00a0\n\nIf market conditions have changed - for example if CVIX has risen - and daily ranges are now higher you should incorporate that. If you know a big event is coming up you might think about that, too. The human brain is a remarkable tool and the power of the eye-ball method is not to be dismissed. This is how most discretionary traders do it.\n\nThere are also more analytical approaches.\n\nSome look at the Average True Range (ATR). This attempts to capture the volatility of a pair, typically averaged over a number of sessions. It looks at three separate measures and takes the largest reading. Think of this as a moving average of how much a pair moves.\n\nFor example, below shows the daily move in EURUSD was around 60 pips before spiking to 140 pips in March. Conditions were clearly far more volatile in March. Accordingly, you would need to leave your stop further away in March and take a correspondingly smaller position size.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ATR is available on pretty much all charting systems](https://preview.redd.it/wr8939dczjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cef3e5ee08a22c287b925546b8374fe491088f9)\n\nProfessional traders tend to use standard deviation as a measure of volatility instead of ATR. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Averages are useful but can be misleading when regimes switch (see above chart).\n\nOnce you have chosen a measure of volatility, stop distance can then be back-tested and optimised. For example does 2x ATR work best or 5x ATR for a given style and time horizon?\u00a0\n\nDiscretionary traders may still eye-ball the ATR or standard deviation to get a feeling for how it has changed over time and what \u2018normal\u2019 feels like for a chosen study period - daily, weekly, monthly etc.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Reasons to change a stop\n\nAs a general rule you should be disciplined and not change your stops. Remember - losers average losers. This is really hard at first and we\u2019re going to look at that in more detail later.\n\nThere are some good reasons to modify stops but they are rare.\n\nOne reason is if another risk management process demands you stop trading and close positions. We\u2019ll look at this later. In that case just close out your positions at market and take the loss/gains as they are.\n\nAnother is event risk. If you have some big upcoming data like Non Farm Payrolls that you know can move the market +/- 150 pips and you have no edge going into the release then many traders will take off or scale down their positions. They\u2019ll go back into the positions when the data is out and the market has quietened down after fifteen minutes or so. This is a matter of some debate - many traders consider it a coin toss and argue you win some and lose some and it all averages out.\n\nTrailing stops can also be used to \u2018lock in\u2019 profits. We looked at those before. As the trade moves in your favour (say up if you are long) the stop loss ratchets with it. This means you may well end up \u2018stopping out\u2019 at a profit - as per the below example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The mighty trailing stop loss order](https://preview.redd.it/v1o6brjzzjh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a022097ae7252ce1c526b3ae41128cd5da509c12)\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to have your stop loss move in the direction of PNL. This is not exposing you to more risk than you originally were comfortable with. It is taking less and less risk as the trade moves in your favour. Trend-followers in particular love trailing stops.\n\nOne final question traders ask is what they should do if they get stopped out but still like the trade. Should they try the same trade again a day later for the same reasons? Nope. Look for a different trade rather than getting emotionally wed to the original idea.\n\nLet\u2019s say a particular stock looked cheap based on valuation metrics yesterday, you bought, it went down and you got stopped out. Well, it is going to look even better on those same metrics today. Maybe the market just doesn\u2019t respect value at the moment and is driven by momentum. Wait it out.\n\nOtherwise, why even have a stop in the first place?\n\n# Entering and exiting winning positions\n\nTake profits are the opposite of stop losses. They are also\u00a0 resting orders, left with the broker, to automatically close your position if it reaches a certain price.\u00a0\n\nImagine I\u2019m long EURUSD at 1.1250. If it hits a previous high of 1.1400 (150 pips higher) I will leave a sell order to take profit and close the position.\n\nThe rookie mistake on take profits is to take profit too early. One should start from the assumption that you will win on no more than half of your trades. Therefore you will need to ensure that you win more on the ones that work than you lose on those that don\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sad to say but incredibly common: retail traders often take profits way too early](https://preview.redd.it/ei0dpp4o0kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ac49994ce98a28b5e6c397161e292fad7b522d)\n\nThis is going to be the exact opposite of what your emotions want you to do. We are going to look at that in the *Psychology of Trading* chapter.\n\nRemember: let winners run. Just like stops you need to know in advance the level where you will close out at a profit. Then let the trade happen. Don\u2019t override yourself and let emotions force you to take a small profit. A classic mistake to avoid.\n\nThe trader puts on a trade and it almost stops out before rebounding. As soon as it is slightly in the money they spook and cut out, instead of letting it run to their original take profit. Do not do this.\n\n## Entering positions with limit orders\n\nThat covers exiting a position but how about getting into one?\n\nTake profits can also be left speculatively to enter a position. Sometimes referred to as \u201cbids\u201d (buy orders) or \u201coffers\u201d (sell orders). Imagine the price is 1.1250 and the recent low is 1.1205.\u00a0\n\nYou might wish to leave a bid around 1.2010 to enter a long position, if the market reaches that price. This way you don\u2019t need to sit at the computer and wait.\n\nAgain, typically traders will use tech analysis to identify attractive levels. Again - other traders will cluster with your orders. Just like the stop loss we need to bake that in.\u00a0\n\nSo this time if we know everyone is going to buy around the recent low of 1.1205 we might leave the take profit bit a little bit above there at 1.1210 to ensure it gets done. Sure it costs 5 more pips but how mad would you be if the low was 1.1207 and then it rallied a hundred points and you didn\u2019t have the trade on?!\n\nThere are two more methods that traders often use for entering a position.\n\nScaling in is one such technique. Let\u2019s imagine that you think we are in a long-term bulltrend for AUDUSD but experiencing a brief retracement. You want to take a total position of 500,000 AUD and don\u2019t have a strong view on the current price action.\n\nYou might therefore leave a series of five bids of 100,000. As the price moves lower each one gets hit. The nice thing about scaling in is it reduces pressure on you to pick the perfect level. Of course the risk is that not all your orders get hit before the price moves higher and you have to trade at-market.\n\nPyramiding is the second technique. Pyramiding is for take profits what a trailing stop loss is to regular stops. It is especially common for momentum traders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pyramiding into a position means buying more as it goes in your favour](https://preview.redd.it/mqa3a7ov0kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6212ac0598e6a4f71ab9b883bed5432815f5d8c7)\n\nAgain let\u2019s imagine we\u2019re bullish AUDUSD and want to take a position of 500,000 AUD.\n\nHere we add 100,000 when our first signal is reached. Then we add subsequent clips of 100,000 when the trade moves in our favour. We are waiting for confirmation that the move is correct.\n\nObviously this is quite nice as we humans love trading when it goes in our direction. However, the drawback is obvious: we haven\u2019t had the full amount of risk on from the start of the trend.\n\nYou can see the attractions and drawbacks of both approaches. It is best to experiment and choose techniques that work for your own personal psychology as these will be the easiest for you to stick with and build a disciplined process around.\n\n# Risk:reward and win ratios\n\nBe extremely skeptical of people who claim to win on 80% of trades. Most traders will win on roughly 50% of trades and lose on 50% of trades. This is why risk management is so important!\n\nOnce you start keeping a trading journal you\u2019ll be able to see how the win/loss ratio looks for you. Until then, assume you\u2019re typical and that every other trade will lose money.\n\nIf that is the case then you need to be sure you make more on the wins than you lose on the losses. You can see the effect of this below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A combination of win &#37; and risk:reward ratio determine if you are profitable](https://preview.redd.it/3t36hyk81kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf08eda09aabfea07a6922cb46e0d6fbaad2b8f)\n\nA typical rule of thumb is that a ratio of 1:3 works well for most traders.\u00a0\n\nThat is, if you are prepared to risk 100 pips on your stop you should be setting a take profit at a level that would return you 300 pips.\u00a0\n\nOne needn\u2019t be religious about these numbers - 11 pips and 28 pips would be perfectly fine\u00a0 - but they are a guideline.\u00a0\n\nAgain - you should still use technical analysis to find meaningful chart levels for both the stop and take profit. Don\u2019t just blindly take your stop distance and do 3x the pips on the other side as your take profit. Use the ratio to set approximate targets and then look for a relevant resistance or support level in that kind of region.\n\n# Risk-adjusted returns\n\nNot all returns are equal. Suppose you are examining the track record of two traders. Now, both have produced a return of 14% over the year. Not bad!\n\nThe first trader, however, made hundreds of small bets throughout the year and his cumulative PNL looked like the left image below.\n\nThe second trader made just one bet \u2014 he sold CADJPY at the start of the year \u2014 and his PNL looked like the right image below with lots of large drawdowns and volatility.\n\n[Would you rather have the first trading record or the second?](https://preview.redd.it/ow3d5m2d1kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=553ca2af562e95bda44d6d2b291fa963089e36f4)\n\nIf you were investing money and betting on who would do well next year which would you choose? Of course all sensible people would choose the first trader. Yet if you look only at returns one cannot distinguish between the two. Both are up 14% at that point in time. This is where the Sharpe ratio helps .\n\nA high Sharpe ratio indicates that a portfolio has better risk-adjusted performance. One cannot sensibly compare returns without considering the risk taken to earn that return.\u00a0\n\nIf I can earn 80% of the return of another investor at only 50% of the risk then a rational investor should simply leverage me at 2x and enjoy 160% of the return at the same level of risk.\n\nThis is very important in the context of Execution Advisor algorithms (EAs) that are popular in the retail community. You must evaluate historic performance by its risk-adjusted return \u2014 not just the nominal return.\u00a0Incidentally look at the Sharpe ratio of ones that have been live for a year or more ...\n\nOtherwise an EA developer could produce two EAs: the first simply buys at 1000:1 leverage on January 1st ; and the second sells in the same manner. At the end of the year, one of them will be discarded and the other will look incredible. Its risk-adjusted return, however, would be abysmal and the odds of repeated success are similarly poor.\n\n## Sharpe ratio\n\nThe Sharpe ratio works like this:\u00a0\n\n* It takes the average returns of your strategy;\n* It deducts from these the risk-free rate of return i.e. the rate anyone could have got by investing in US government bonds with very little risk;\n* It then divides this total return by its own volatility - the more smooth the return the higher and better the Sharpe, the more volatile the lower and worse the Sharpe.\n\nFor example, say the return last year was 15% with a volatility of 10% and US bonds are trading at 2%. That gives (15-2)/10 or a Sharpe ratio of 1.3. As a rule of thumb a Sharpe ratio of above 0.5 would be considered decent for a discretionary retail trader. Above 1 is excellent.\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to know how to calculate Sharpe ratios. Good trading software will do this for you. It will either be available in the system by default or you can add a plug-in.\n\n## VAR\n\nVAR is another useful measure to help with drawdowns. It stands for Value at Risk. Normally people will use 99% VAR (conservative) or 95% VAR (aggressive). Let\u2019s say you\u2019re long EURUSD and using 95% VAR. The system will look at the historic movement of EURUSD. It might spit out a number of -1.2%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A 5&#37; VAR of -1.2&#37; tells you you should expect to lose 1.2&#37; on 5&#37; of days, whilst 95&#37; of days should be better than that](https://preview.redd.it/jos9ubtl1kh51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b5c92d3525a68409b9bb0f38fe6e7305184163)\n\nThis means it is expected that on 5 days out of 100 (hence the 95%) the portfolio will lose 1.2% or more. This can help you manage your capital by taking appropriately sized positions. Typically you would look at VAR across your portfolio of trades rather than trade by trade.\n\nSharpe ratios and VAR don\u2019t give you the whole picture, though. Legendary fund manager, Howard Marks of Oaktree, notes that, while tools like VAR and Sharpe ratios are helpful and absolutely necessary, the best investors will also overlay their own judgment.\u00a0\n\n*Investors can calculate risk metrics like VaR and Sharpe ratios (we use them at Oaktree; they\u2019re the best tools we have), but they shouldn\u2019t put too much faith in them. The bottom line for me is that risk management should be the responsibility of every participant in the investment process, applying experience, judgment and knowledge of the underlying investments.Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital*\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is don\u2019t misplace your common sense. Do use these tools as they are helpful. However, you cannot fully rely on them. Both assume a normal distribution of returns. Whereas in real life you get \u201cblack swans\u201d - events that should supposedly happen only once every thousand years but which actually seem to happen fairly often.\u00a0\n\nThese outlier events are often referred to as \u201ctail risk\u201d. Don\u2019t make the mistake of saying \u201cwell, the model said\u2026\u201d - overlay what the model is telling you with your own common sense and good judgment.\n\n# Coming up in part III\n\n[Available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ie0617/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_risk_management/)\n\n  \nSqueezes and other risks\n\nMarket positioning\n\nBet correlation\n\nCrap trades, timeouts and monthly limits\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Disclaimer:This content is not investment advice and you should not place any reliance on it.

        "title": "How to get started in Forex - A comprehensive guide for newbies",
        "description": "Almost every day people come to this subreddit asking the same basic questions over and over again.  I've put this guide together to point you in the right direction and help you get started on your forex journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA quick background on me before you ask:  My name is Bob, I'm based out of western Canada.  I started my forex journey back in January 2018 and am still learning.   However I am trading live, not on demo accounts.  I also code my own EA's.  I not certified, licensed, insured, or even remotely qualified as a professional in the finance industry.   **Nothing I say constitutes financial advice.**  Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, but everything I've outlined below is a synopsis of some tough lessons I've learned over the last year of being in this business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LET'S GET SOME UNPLEASANTNESS OUT OF THE WAY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to call you stupid.  I'm also going to call you dumb.   I'm going to call you many other things.   I do this because odds are, you are stupid, foolish,and just asking to have your money taken away.  Welcome to the 95% of retail traders.  Perhaps uneducated or uninformed are better phrases, but I've never been a big proponent of being politically correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWant to get out of the 95% and join the 5% of us who actually make money doing this?   Put your grown up pants on, buck up, and don't give me any of this pc \"This is hurting my feelings so I'm not going to listen to you\" bullshit that the world has been moving towards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's rip the bandage off quickly on this point - **the world does not give a fuck about you**.  At one point maybe it did, it was this amazing vision nicknamed the American Dream.   It died an agonizing, horrible death at the hand of capitalists and entrepreneurs.   The world today revolves around money.   Your money, my money, everybody's money.  People want to take your money to add it to theirs.  They don't give a fuck if it forces you out on the street and your family has to live in cardboard box.   The world just stopped caring in general.   It sucks, but it's the way the world works now.   Welcome to the new world order.   It's called Capitalism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd here comes the next hard truth that you will need to accept - **Forex is a cruel bitch of a mistress.  She will hurt you.  She will torment you. She will give you nightmares.  She will keep you awake at night.  And then she will tease you with a glimmer of hope to lure you into a false sense of security before she then guts you like a fish and shows you what your insides look like.**  This statement applies to all trading markets - they are cruel, ruthless, and not for the weak minded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sooner you accept these truths, the sooner you will become profitable.  Don't accept it?  That's fine.  Don't bother reading any further.  If I've offended you I don't give a fuck.  You can run back home and hide under your bed.   The world doesn't care and neither do I.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor what it's worth - I am not normally an major condescending asshole like the above paragraphs would suggest.  In fact, if you look through my posts on this subreddit you will see I am actually quite helpful most of the time to many people who come here.  But I need you to really understand that **Forex is not for most people**.  **It will make you cry.  And if the markets themselves don't do it, the people in the markets will.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 1 - LEARN THE BASICS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSave yourself and everybody here a bunch of time - learn the basics of forex.   You can learn the basics for free - BabyPips has one of the best free courses online which explains what exactly forex is, how it works, different strategies and methods of how to approach trading, and many other amazing topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can access the BabyPips course by clicking this link:  [**https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex**](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo EVERY course in the School of Pipsology.  It's free, it's comprehensive, and it will save you from a lot of trouble.  It also has the added benefit of preventing you from looking foolish and uneducated when you come here asking for help if you already know this stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you still have questions about how forex works, please see the FREE RESOURCES links on the /r/Forex FAQ which can be found here:  [**https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quiz Time**\n\nAnswer these questions truthfully to yourself:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-What is the difference between a market order, a stop order, and a limit order?\n\n\\-How do you draw a support/resistance line?  (Demonstrate it to yourself)\n\n\\-What is the difference between MACD, RSI, and Stochastic indicators?\n\n\\-What is fundamental analysis and how does it differ from technical analysis and price action trading?\n\n\\-True or False:  It's better to have a broker who gives you 500:1 margin instead of 50:1 margin.   Be able to justify your reasoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't know to answer to any of these questions, then you aren't ready to move on.  Go back to the School of Pipsology linked above and do it all again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can answer these questions without having to refer to any kind of reference then congratulations, you are ready to move past being a forex newbie and are ready to dive into the wonderful world of currency trading!  Move onto Lesson 2 below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 2 - RANDOM STRANGERS ARE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU GET RICH IN FOREX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may come as a bit of a shock to you, but that random stranger on instagram who is posting about how he is killing it on forex is not trying to insprire you to greatness.   He's also not trying to help you.  He's also not trying to teach you how to attain financial freedom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n99.99999% of people posting about wanting to help you become rich in forex are **LYING TO YOU**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would such nice, polite people do such a thing?   Because **THEY ARE TRYING TO PROFIT FROM YOUR STUPIDITY**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlain and simple.  Here's just a few ways these \"experts\" and \"gurus\" profit from you:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Referral Links** \\- If they require you to click a specific link to signup for something, it means they are an affiliate.  They get a commission from whatever the third party is that they are sending you to.  I don't care if it's a brokerage, training program, hell even an Amazon link to a book - if they insist you have to click their super exclusive, can't-get-this-deal-any-other-way-but-clicking-my-link type bullshit, it's an affiliate link.   There is nothing inherently wrong with affiliate programs, but you are literally generating money for some stranger because they convinced you to buy something.  Some brokers such as ICMarkets have affiliate programs that payout a percentage of the commission you generate - this is a really clever system - whether you profit or blow your entire account, the person who referred you to the broker makes a profit off you.  Clever eh?\n* **Signal Services, Education & Training Programs, Courses** \\- If somebody is telling you they are making a killing with a signal service and are trying to convince you to join it, I guarantee they are getting a piece of your monthly fee.   And better still, these signal services often work...for about a week.  Just long enough to suck a bunch of poor fools into it.   You see people making money, you want in so you agree to pay the $200+/month subscription fee.  You follow the signals and it looks like it's making money for a few days or weeks.  Then it turns sideways, you start losing money hand over fist.   Pretty soon you have lost most of your trading account because you blindly followed a signal service.   And better still - when you go screaming at the person running the signal service they will be very quick to point you to their No Refunds policy.   To add insult to injury, the buttfucker that referred you to the signal service in the past will likely listen to you getting mad, and then come back with something like \"Sorry it didn't work out, but I just joined this other amazing service and it's working great, you should come join it to earn your money back.  Here's my link...\"    You get the point here right?\n* **Multi-Level Marketing (MLMs)** \\- These people are scum.  They are going to offer you training and education, signals, access to forex experts and gurus, and all kinds of other shit with the promise that you will live the dream and become financially free.   They are also loading you into a pyrmaid scheme where you will be hounded to recruit other people and make money off them just like you got roped into it.   A really prime example here is iMarkets Live (or IML for short).  Don't touch this shit with a 10 foot pole.   I don't care what they are claiming, you will lose everything using them.\n* **Fund Managers** \\- These people make my skin crawl.  It's a classic scam and it works like this - somebody will post online about how much money they are making trading forex/commodities/stocks/whatever.  Most of the time they won't explicitly post they are offering a trading service, rather they just put the message out there and wait for the ignorant masses (that's you) to contact them.  They will charm you.  They will lie to you.  They will promise you the moon if you simply wire them some money or give them API access to your trading account.   Care to guess what happens next?   If you send a wire transfer (or Western Union...hell any kind of payment to them) they will vanish.  Happens usually after they take a bunch of suckers for the ride.   You sent them $2,000 and so do 9 other suckers.  They just made $20,000 and are gone.   With API access to your account, you will find your account gets blown super fast or worse - possibly leaving you open to persecution by the broker you are using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just a few examples.   The reality is that very few people make it big in forex or any kind of trading.   If somebody is trying to sell you the dream, they are essentially a magician - making you look the other way while they snatch your wallet and clean you out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, on the topic of fund managers -  **legitimate fund managers will be certified, licensed, and insured**.   Ask them for proof of those 3 things.   What they typically look like are:\n\n* **Certified** \\- This varies from country to country, in the US it's FINRA ([http://www.finra.org](http://www.finra.org)).  They need to have their Series 7 certification minimum.  You can make the case that other FINRA certifications are acceptable in lieu of Series 7, but the 7 is the gold standard.\n* **Licensed** \\- They need to have a valid business license issued by the government.  It must clearly state they are an investment company, preferrably a hedge fund because they have some super strict requirements to operate (and often require $25,000+ in fees just to get their business license, so you know they at least have some skin in the game).\n* **Insured** \\- They need to be backed by an insurance company.  I'm not talking general insurance for shit like their office burning down.  I'm talking about a government-implemented protection insurance program - in the US I believe that is issued by the Securities Investment Protection Corporation ([https://www.sipc.org/](https://www.sipc.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are talking to a fund manager and they are insisting they have all of these, **get a copy of their verification documents and lookup their licenses on the directories of the issuers to verify they are valid**.   If they are, then at least you are talking to somebody who seems to have their shit together and is doing investment management and trading as a professional and you are at least partially protected when the shit hits the fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 3 - UNDERSTAND YOUR RISK**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people jump into Forex, drop $2000 into a broker account and start trading 1 lot orders because they signed up with a broker thinking they will get rich because they were given 500:1 margin and can risk it all on each trade.   Worst-case scenario you lose your account, best case scenario you become a millionaire very quickly.   Seems like a pretty good gamble right?   You are dead wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a new trader, you should never risk more than 1% of  your account balance on a trade.  If you have some experience and are confident and doing well, then it's perfectly natural to risk 2-3% of your account per trade.   **Anybody who risks more than 4-5% of their account on a single trade deserves to blow their account.  At that point you aren't trading, you are gambling.  Don't pretend you are a trader when really you are just putting everything on red and hoping the roulette ball lands in the right spot.**   It's stupid and reckless and going to screw you very quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's do some math here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou put $2,000 into your trading account.\n\n**Risking 1%** means you are willing to lose $20 per trade.   That means you are going to be trading micro lots, or 0.01 lots most likely ($0.10/pip).   At that level you can have a trade stop loss at -200 pips and only lose $20.  It's the best starting point for anybody.   Additionally, if you SL 20 trades in a row you are only down $200 (or 10% of your account) which isn't that difficult to recover from.\n\n**Risking 3%** means you are willing to lose $60 per trade.   You could do mini lots at this point, which is 0.1 lots (or $1/pip).  Let's say you SL on 20 trades in a row.  You've just lost $1,200 or 60% of your account.  Even veteran traders will go through periods of repeat SL'ing, you are not a special snowflake and are not immune to periods of major drawdown.\n\n**Risking 5%** means you are willing to lose $100 per trade.   SL 20 trades in a row, your account is blown.   As Red Foreman would call it - Good job dumbass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever risk more than 1% of your account on any trade until you can show that you are either consistently breaking even or making a profit.  By consistently, I mean 200 trades minimum.   You do 200 trades over a period of time and either break-even or make a profit, then you should be alright to increase your risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, this is where many retail traders get greedy and blow it.  They will do 10 trades and hit their profit target on 9 of them.  They will start seeing huge piles of money in their future and get greedy.  They will start taking more risk on their trades than their account can handle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**200 trades of break-even or profitable performance risking 1% per trade.  Don't even think about increasing your risk tolerance until you do it.    When you get to this point, increase you risk to 2%.   Do 1,000 trades at this level and show break-even or profit.**  If you blow your account, go back down to 1% until you can figure out what the hell you did differently or wrong, fix your strategy, and try again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you clear 1,000 trades at 2%, it's really up to you if you want to increase your risk.  I don't recommend it.   Even 2% is bordering on gambling to be honest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 4 - THE 500 PIP DRAWDOWN RULE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a rule I created for myself and it's a great way to help protect your account from blowing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes the market goes insane.  Like really insane.  Insane to the point that your broker can't keep up and they can't hold your orders to the SL and TP levels you specified.   They will try, but during a flash crash like we had at the start of January 2019 the rules can sometimes go flying out the window on account of the trading servers being unable to keep up with all the shit that's hitting the fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of this I live by a rule I call the 500 Pip Drawdown Rule and it's really quite simple - **Have enough funds in your account to cover a 500 pip drawdown on your largest open trade**.  I don't care if you set a SL of -50 pips.   During a flash crash that shit sometimes just breaks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's use an example - you open a 0.1 lot short order on USDCAD and set the SL to 50 pips (so you'd only lose $50 if you hit stoploss).  An hour later Trump makes some absurd announcement which causes a massive fundamental event on the market.   A flash crash happens and over the course of the next few minutes USDCAD spikes up 500 pips, your broker is struggling to keep shit under control and your order slips through the cracks.  By the time your broker is able to clear the backlog of orders and activity, your order closes out at 500 pips in the red.  You just lost $500 when you intended initially to only risk $50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt gets kinda scary if you are dealing with whole lot orders.  A single order with a 500 pip drawdown is $5,000 gone in an instant.   That will decimate many trader accounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember my statements above about Forex being a cruel bitch of a mistress?  I wasn't kidding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted - the above scenario is very rare to actually happen.  But glitches to happen from time to time.  Broker servers go offline.   Weird shit happens which sets off a fundamental shift.   Lots of stuff can break your account very quickly if you aren't using proper risk management.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 5 - UNDERSTAND DIFFERENT TRADING METHODOLOGIES**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally speaking, there are 3 trading methodologies that traders employ.   It's important to figure out what method you intend to use before asking for help.  Each has their pros and cons, and you can combine them in a somewhat hybrid methodology but that introduces challenges as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n* **Price Action Trading (Sometimes called Naked Trading)** is very effective at identifying when trends will start and finish.  This gives you the advantage of staying ahead of the market and predicting when a change in trend direction will occur.  It has the disadvantage of being really easy to screw it up if you don't plot your support and resistance lines properly and interpret the chart wrong.  Because you can identify a change in trend direction, you'll generally make more profit on a new trend than a technical strategy will.\n* **Technical Analytics (or TA)** uses math and statistics to try and identify where the market is headed or confirm/reject whether a trend is happening.  It has the advantage of being very math and stat driven which is hard to refute the numbers, but it has the disadvantage of being late to the party when it comes to identifying trends (hence why people call TA a lagging strategy).  When people fail using TA, it's not because of the math - it's because you misinterpreted what the math is telling you.\n* **Fundamental Analysis (or FA)** uses news and macro scale events to predict what is going on.   A really good example right now is Brexit, what a clusterfuck that is.  Every time some major brexit news breaks it causes all sorts of choas in almost every currency pair.  Fundamental trading has the highest potential profitability per trade but it also has the highest potential drawdown per trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you may be thinking that you want to be a a price action trader - you should still learn the principles and concepts behind TA and FA.  Same if you are planning to be a technical trader - you should learn about price action and fundamental analysis.  More knowledge is better, always.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith regards to technical analysis, you need to really understand what the different indicators are tell you.  It's very easy to misinterpret what an indicator is telling you, which causes you to make a bad trade and lose money.   It's also important to understand that every indicator can be tuned to your personal preferences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might find, for example, that using Bollinger Bands with the normal 20 period SMA close, 2 standard deviation is not effective for how you look at the chart, but changing that to say a 20 period EMA average price, 1 standard deviation bollinger band indicator could give you significantly more insight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 6 - TIMEFRAMES MATTER**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstanding the differences in which timeframes you trade on will make or break your chosen strategy.  Some strategies work really well on Daily timeframes (i.e. Ichimoku) but they fall flat on their face if you use them on 1H timeframes, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There is no right or wrong answer on what timeframe is best to trade on**.  Generally speaking however, there are 2 things to consider:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Speed** \\- If you are scalping (trading on the really fast candles like 1M, 5M, 15M, etc) odds are your trades are very short lived.  Maybe 10 minutes to an hour tops.  For the most part, scalping strategies will produce little profit per trade but make up for it in the sheer volume of trades.  Whereas swing trading may only make a few trades but each one could be worth a significant amount of money.\n* **Spread** (the fee you pay to the broker when you trade) - If you are a scalper, the spread is your worst enemy because you have to overcome it very fast to make a  profit on your order.  Whereas swing trading the spread hardly impacts you at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are a total newbie to forex, **I suggest you don't trade on anything shorter than the 1H timeframe when you are first learning**.  Trading on higher timeframes tends to be much more forgiving and profitable per trade.  Scalping is a delicate art and requires finesse and can be very challenging when you are first starting out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 7 - AUTOBOTS...ROLL OUT!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah...I'm a geek and grew up with the Transformers franchise decades before Michael Bay came along.  Deal with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nForex bots are called EA's (Expert Advisors).  They can be wonderous and devastating at the same time.  /r/Forex is not really the best place to get help with them.  That is what /r/algotrading is useful for.   However some of us that lurk on /r/Forex code EA's and will try to assist when we can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnybody can learn to code an EA.   But just like how 95% of retail traders fail, I would estimate the same is true for forex bots.  Either the strategy doesn't work, the code is buggy, or many other reasons can cause EA's to fail.   Because **EA's can often times run up hundreds of orders in a very quick period of time, it's critical that you test them repeatedly before letting them lose on a live trading account so they don't blow your account to pieces**.  You have been warned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to learn how to code an EA, I suggest you start with MQL.  It's a programming language which can be directly interpretted by Meta Trader.  The Meta Trader terminal client even gives you a built in IDE for coding EA's in MQL.   The downside is it can be buggy and glitchy and caused many frustrating hours of work to figure out what is wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't want to learn MQL, you can code an EA up in just about any programming language.   Python is really popular for forex bots for some reason.   But that doesn't mean you couldn't do it in something like C++ or Java or hell even something more unusual like JQuery if you really wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not going to get into the finer details of how to code EA's, there are some amazing guides out there.  Just be careful with them.  They can be your best friend and at the same time also your worst enemy when it comes to forex.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One final note on EA's - don't buy them.  Ever.**  Let me put this into perspective - I create an EA which is literally producing money for me automatically 24/5.  If it really is a good EA which is profitable, there is no way in hell I'm selling it.   I'm keeping it to myself to make a fortune off of.   EA's that are for sale will not work, will blow your account, and the developer who coded it will tell you that's too darn bad but no refunds.   Don't ever buy an EA from anybody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LESSON 8 - BRING ON THE HATERS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are going to find that this subreddit is frequented by trolls.   Some of them will get really nasty.  Some of them will threaten you.  Some of them will just make you miserable.  It's the price you pay for admission to the /r/Forex club.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can't handle it, then I suggest you don't post here.   Find a more newbie-friendly site.   It sucks, but it's reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe often refer to trolls on this subreddit as shitcunts.   That's your word of the day.  Learn it, love it.  Shitcunts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOU MADE IT, WELCOME TO FOREX!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've made it through all of the above and aren't cringing or getting scared, then welcome aboard the forex train!   You will fit in nicely here.   Ask your questions and the non-shitcunts of our little corner of reddit will try to help you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssuming this post doesn't get nuked and I don't get banned for it, I'll add more lessons to this post over time.   Lessons I intend to add in the future:\n\n* Demo Trading\n* Why you will blow your first account and what to do when it happens\n* Trading Psychology (this will be a beefy one and will take a while to put together)\n* Exotics vs Majors and which you should focus on as a newbie (aka how to blow your account in a single trade with exotics)\n* Which Broker Should You Use?   (This is covered in pretty good detail on the FAQ already - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/wiki/index) \\- so I may not bother)\n* Hedging (there isn't really a good guide written on this anywhere)\n* Doubling Your Risk to Save Your Ass or Lose a Shit Ton (aka Martingale & Anti-Martingale)\n* Risk On/Off\n* Forex Calendars\n* Currency Strength / Heat Maps\n* Swap\n* Margin Calls (What are they and why are you getting them?)\n\nIf there is something else you feel should be included please drop a comment and I'll add it to the above list of pending topics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBob\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Nice one Bob! You must be either drunk, high, or both because it likely took you an hour to write that up. ",
            "Good read, I'll just add to Lesson 7 as that seems to be a topic many are at least interested in. I guess I'll start with the theory is you can make money doing nothing, the reality? A bit different.\n\nPersonally I think a lot of people fail with EA's because they didn't actually have a good strategy to begin with. I see people all the time going \"oh, I made X on demo doing this, I'll just program an EA to do that too and retire on a beach\". Yeah, that's not how it works.\n\nWhen I begin with EA's, I went for broke and bought a pretty massive server rack (someone had to come out and re-wire my house and one bedroom is solely dedicated to servers, my power bill is thousands a month) and ran the absolute piss out of the systems for months; I still try to improve the EA every week when the market is closed. I wasn't building an EA based on what I thought was correct. I let the system decide what worked best in the past for each pair with a given amount of money, risk, leverage, etc. And then the system just uses that strategy to trade live for the week. At the end of the week I make sure the results are within the parameters and give it tick data for the last week so it can learn a bit more. Most the time I honestly don't know what it's doing, I got a rough idea but I just know it would make money in the past and history usually repeats itself.\n\nI currently run an individual EA for each pair and time frame. If you think one EA is going to trade every pair and every time frame, I got some bad news for you. EA's don't adapt like you do, you trade and even sub-consciously you'll see something that you'll adapt to. You can probably use roughly the same strategy on multiple pairs because you're not a machine.\n\nUnless you're a mega geek, IMO you're best off staying away from EA's. You will not buy an off the shelf EA and make money; most the time you can even see this on the stats they provide. A whole lot of them are using Martingale and they can just move a few parameters until it provides good results for the month or whatever of back test. You'd be surprised how radically different an EA is if you set something like your MA to 13 or 15 instead of 14. That doesn't mean it'll keep working, that means they just tried over and over until the results were good so they could sell their crap. I could make an EA that is entirely random and if I back test it enough times eventually it'll come up with results that I can brag about and get some suckers to pay for.\n\nIf their EA makes money, they're keeping it for themselves. Why the hell would anyone sell it? So they can deal with (let's be honest here) dip shits that want to retire next week because they invested $100? I don't got time for that crap and I don't need the money; **if you got a system that makes money and you want to scale, you start a hedge fund. You don't sell software.** Especially software that costs thousands of dollars a month to update. I'm afraid you ain't getting that for a one time fee of $29.\n\nAnd if you don't believe any of this... try this out. Find 10 random free ea's, download them, back test them. Now run the same back test again. Probably half those EA's are going to come up with different results. Run it enough times and eventually it'll show a profit. That's how they sell you on EA's that ultimately don't do shit. Most people won't run the exact same test twice, and most people can't read code, so they get away with it.",

The market goes wacky all the time, takes out stop losses and keeps on chugging in the direction of your trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith stocks, I can buy an out-of-the-money stock option which will reduce my profit, but also leave the decision to exercise the stop loss up to me at any time up until expiry. Example: I think stock $MU is going to moon because of earnings. But there is a 30% probability it will crater. So I go long $MU and buy a out-of-the-money put option at my stop loss. $MU moons, I profit. $MU goes nowhere, I'm out my put option premium. $MU craters and then bounces back, I profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I achieve the same thing in forex?

Yes there are so many shitcunts on YouTube trying to sell the dream of being a Forex Trader but it's completely opposite, some of their courses and videos is just completely bullshit, some of them don't even explain one bit of technical analysis and wanting people to fork out hundreds where then can learn for free from Babypips and be more educated than these shit cunts.   \n\n\nI can't believe some of these shitcunts are telling people to leverage 10% or more. Turn $1000 to $10000, $10,000 to hundreds in months... The harsh reality is that it will take you 1 year of consistency to double your money, if you blow half your account it will take you 100% profit and at least 2 years to get back where you started.  \n\n\nPeace.

        "description": "Welcome to the third and final part of this chapter.\n\nThank you all for the 100s of comments and upvotes - maybe this post will take us above 1,000 for this topic!\n\nKeep any feedback or questions coming in the replies below.\n\nBefore you read this note, please start with [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ia5f37/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_some_thoughts/) and then [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/ibd24i/former_investment_bank_fx_trader_risk_management/) so it hangs together and makes sense.\n\n**Part III**\n\n* Squeezes and other risks\n* Market positioning\n* Bet correlation\n* Crap trades, timeouts and monthly limits\n\n# Squeezes and other risks\n\nWe are going to cover three common risks that traders face: events; squeezes, asymmetric bets.\n\n## Events\n\nEconomic releases can cause large short-term volatility. The most famous is Non Farm Payrolls, which is the most widely watched measure of US employment levels and affects the price of many instruments.On an NFP announcement currencies like EURUSD might jump (or drop) 100 pips no problem.\u00a0\n\nThis is fine and there are trading strategies that one may employ around this but the key thing is to be aware of these releases.You can find economic calendars all over the internet - including on this site - and you need only check if there are any major releases each day or week.\n\nFor example, if you are trading off some intraday chart and scalping a few pips here and there it would be highly sensible to go into a known data release flat as it is pure coin-toss and not the reason for your trading. It only takes five minutes each day to plan for the day ahead so do not get caught out by this. Many retail traders get stopped out on such events when price volatility is at its peak.\n\n## Squeezes\n\nShort squeezes bring a lot of danger and perhaps some opportunity.\n\nThe story of VW and Porsche is the best short squeeze ever. Throughout these articles we've used FX examples wherever possible but in this one instance the concept (which is also highly relevant in FX) is best illustrated with an historical lesson from a different asset class.\n\nA short squeeze is when a participant ends up in a short position they are forced to cover. Especially when the rest of the market knows that this participant can be bullied into stopping out at terrible levels, provided the market can briefly drive the price into their pain zone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[There's a reason for the car, don't worry](https://preview.redd.it/pm8j09czsdi51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88fa54fe275bbdab86d3e7103daa7709a8ca5e82)\n\nHedge funds had been shorting VW stock. However the amount of VW stock available to buy in the open market was actually quite limited. The local government owned a chunk and Porsche itself had bought and locked away around 30%. Neither of these would sell to the hedge-funds so a good amount of the stock was un-buyable at any price.\n\nIf you sell or short a stock you must be prepared to buy it back to go flat at some point.\n\nTo cut a long story short, Porsche bought a lot of call options on VW stock. These options gave them the right to purchase VW stock from banks at slightly above market price.\u00a0\n\nEventually the banks who had sold these options realised there was no VW stock to go out and buy since the German government wouldn\u2019t sell its allocation and Porsche wouldn\u2019t either. If Porsche called in the options the banks were in trouble.\n\nPorsche called in the options which forced the shorts to buy stock - at whatever price they could get it.\n\nThe price squeezed higher as those that were short got massively squeezed and stopped out.\u00a0 For one brief moment in 2008, VW was the world\u2019s most valuable company. Shorts were burned hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Incredible event](https://preview.redd.it/5b971c91tdi51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9b9c735c39c5f6f1bd7e971e88e04341a7858fc)\n\nPorsche apparently made $11.5 billion on the trade. The BBC described Porsche as \u201ca hedge fund with a carmaker attached.\u201d\n\nIf this all seems exotic then know that the same thing happens in FX all the time. If everyone in the market is talking about a key level in EURUSD being 1.2050 then you can bet the market will try to push through 1.2050 just to take out any short stops at that level. Whether it then rallies higher or fails and trades back lower is a different matter entirely.\n\nThis brings us on to the matter of crowded trades. We will look at positioning in more detail in the next section. Crowded trades are dangerous for PNL. If everyone believes EURUSD is going down and has already sold EURUSD then you run the risk of a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\nFor additional selling to take place you need a very good reason for people to add to their position whereas a move in the other direction could force mass buying to cover their shorts.\n\nA trading mentor when I worked at the investment bank once advised me:\n\n*Always think about which move would cause the maximum people the maximum pain. That move is precisely what you should be watching out for at all times.*\n\n## Asymmetric losses\n\nAlso known as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. This risk has caught out many a retail trader. Sometimes it is referred to as a \"negative skew\" strategy.\n\nIdeally what you are looking for is asymmetric risk trade set-ups: that is where the downside is clearly defined and smaller than the upside. What you want to avoid is the opposite.\n\nA famous example of this going wrong was the Swiss National Bank de-peg in 2012.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank had said they would defend the price of EURCHF so that it did not go below 1.2. Many people believed it could never go below 1.2 due to this. Many retail traders therefore opted for a strategy that some describe as \u2018picking up pennies in front of a steam-roller\u2019.\u00a0\n\nThey would would buy EURCHF above the peg level and hope for a tiny rally of several pips before selling them back and keep doing this repeatedly. Often they were highly leveraged at 100:1 so that they could amplify the profit of the tiny 5-10 pip rally.\n\nThen this happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Something that changed FX markets forever](https://preview.redd.it/2e05g7x2tdi51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d93a5ad08308adacf65699fcd9e6334964e7784)\n\nThe SNB suddenly did the unthinkable. They stopped defending the price. CHF jumped and so EURCHF (the number of CHF per 1 EUR) dropped to new lows very fast. Clearly, this trade had horrific risk : reward asymmetry: you risked 30% to make 0.05%.\n\nOther strategies like naively selling options have the same result. You win a small amount of money each day and [then spectacularly blow up](https://www.tampabay.com/business/how-tampas-james-cordier-went-from-high-roller-to-youtube-apology-after-losing-150-million-20190206/) at some point down the line.\n\n# Market positioning\n\nWe have talked about short squeezes. But how do you know what the market position is? And should you care?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first. You should definitely care.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine the entire market is exceptionally long EURUSD and positioning reaches extreme levels. This makes EURUSD very vulnerable.\u00a0\n\nTo keep the price going higher EURUSD needs to attract fresh buy orders. If everyone is *already* long and has no room to add, what can incentivise people to keep buying? The news flow might be good. They may believe EURUSD goes higher. But they have already bought and have their maximum position on.\n\nOn the flip side, if there\u2019s an unexpected event and EURUSD gaps lower you will have the entire market trying to exit the position at the same time. Like a herd of cows running through a single doorway. Messy.\n\nWe are going to look at this in more detail in a later chapter, where we discuss \u2018carry\u2019 trades. For now this TRYJPY chart might provide some idea of what a rush to the exits of a crowded position looks like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A carry trade position clear-out in action](https://preview.redd.it/y1z1nnr4tdi51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=0460c19bb2d9e29020d6158ea8ed031ab29a1c3c)\n\nKnowing if the market is currently at extreme levels of long or short can therefore be helpful.\u00a0\n\nThe CFTC makes available a weekly report, which details the overall positions of speculative traders \u201cNon Commercial Traders\u201d in some of the major futures products. This includes futures tied to deliverable FX pairs such as EURUSD as well as products such as gold. The report is called \u201cCFTC Commitments of Traders\u201d (\"COT\").\n\nThis is a great benchmark. It is far more representative of the overall market than the proprietary ones offered by retail brokers as it covers a far larger cross-section of the institutional market.\u00a0\n\nGenerally market participants will not pay a lot of attention to commercial hedgers, which are also detailed in the report. This data is worth tracking but these folks are simply hedging real-world transactions rather than speculating so their activity is far less revealing and far more noisy.\u00a0\n\nYou can find the data online for free and [download it directly here](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/HistoricalViewable/index.htm).\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Raw format is kinda hard to work with](https://preview.redd.it/f0qg3i56tdi51.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e9a2556e8c99e455ba7bd4838bd1775edba0325)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, many websites will chart this for you free of charge and you may find it more convenient to look at it that way. Just google \u201cCFTC positioning charts\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[But you can easily get visualisations](https://preview.redd.it/q663yym7tdi51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=27966fe019384708d4fc985f71a3c41a37f9ca8f)\n\nYou can visually spot extreme positioning. It is extremely powerful.\u00a0\n\nBear in mind the reports come out Friday afternoon US time and the report is a snapshot up to the prior Tuesday. That means it is a lagged report - by the time it is released it is a few days out of date. For longer term trades where you hold positions for weeks this is of course still pretty helpful information.\n\nAs well as the absolute level (is the speculative market net long or short) you can also use this to pick up on changes in positioning.\u00a0\n\nFor example if bad news comes out how much does the net short increase? If good news comes out, the market may remain net short but how much did they buy back?\n\nA lot of traders ask themselves \u201cDoes the market have this trade on?\u201d The positioning data is a good method for answering this. It provides a good finger on the pulse of the wider market sentiment and activity.\u00a0\n\nFor example you might say: \u201cThere was lots of noise about the good employment numbers in the US. However, there wasn\u2019t actually a lot of position change on the back of it. Maybe everyone who wants to buy already has. What would happen now if bad news came out?\u201d\n\nIn general traders will be wary of entering a crowded position because it will be hard to attract additional buyers or sellers and there could be an aggressive exit.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to enter a trade that is showing extreme levels of positioning you must think carefully about this dynamic.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bet correlation\n\nRetail traders often drastically underestimate how correlated their bets are.\n\n*Through bitter experience, I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading. If you have eight highly correlated positions, then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large.*\n\n*Bruce Kovner of hedge fund, Caxton Associates*\n\nFor example, if you are trading a bunch of pairs against the USD you will end up with a simply huge USD exposure. A single USD-trigger can ruin all your bets. Your ideal scenario \u2014 and it isn\u2019t always possible \u2014 would be to have a highly diversified portfolio of bets that do not move in tandem.\u00a0\n\nLook at this chart. Inverted USD index (DXY) is green. AUDUSD is orange. EURUSD is blue.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart from TradingView](https://preview.redd.it/ksx0xii9tdi51.jpg?width=1199&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86b703a6d5ca32bb1a19799c5d957b76e094f8f2)\n\nSo the whole thing is just one big USD trade! If you are long AUDUSD, long EURUSD, and short DXY you have three anti USD bets that are all likely to work or fail together.\n\nThe more diversified your portfolio of bets are, the more risk you can take on each.\n\nThere\u2019s a [really good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu4lHaSh7D4), explaining the benefits of diversification from Ray Dalio.\n\nA systematic fund with access to an investable universe of 10,000 instruments has more opportunity to make a better risk-adjusted return than a trader who only focuses on three symbols. Diversification really is the closest thing to a free lunch in finance.\n\nBut let\u2019s be pragmatic and realistic. Human retail traders don\u2019t have capacity to run even one hundred bets at a time. More realistic would be an average of 2-3 trades on simultaneously. So what can be done?\n\nFor example:\n\n* You might diversify across time horizons by having a mix of short-term and long-term trades. \u00a0\n* You might diversify across asset classes - trading some FX but also crypto and equities.\n* You might diversify your trade generation approach so you are not relying on the same indicators or drivers on each trade.\n* You might diversify your exposure to the market regime by having some trades that assume a trend will continue (momentum) and some that assume we will be range-bound (carry).\n\nAnd so on. Basically you want to scan your portfolio of trades and make sure you are not putting all your eggs in one basket. If some trades underperform others will perform - assuming the bets are not correlated - and that way you can ensure your overall portfolio takes less risk per unit of return.\u00a0\n\nThe key thing is to start thinking about a portfolio of bets and what each new trade offers to your existing portfolio of risk. Will it diversify or amplify a current exposure?\n\n# Crap trades, timeouts and monthly limits\n\nOne common mistake is to get bored and restless and put on crap trades. This just means trades in which you have low conviction.\u00a0\n\nIt is perfectly fine not to trade. If you feel like you do not understand the market at a particular point, simply choose not to trade.\u00a0\n\nFlat is a position.\n\nDo not waste your bullets on rubbish trades. Only enter a trade when you have carefully considered it from all angles and feel good about the risk. This will make it far easier to hold onto the trade if it moves against you at any point. You actually believe in it.\n\nEqually, you need to set monthly limits. A standard limit might be a 10% account balance stop per month. At that point you close all your positions immediately and stop trading till next month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Be strict with yourself and walk away](https://preview.redd.it/n9fg9s5btdi51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=27a6029f24d27d508e0356904ed3044419663dbc)\n\nLet\u2019s assume you started the year with $100k and made 5% in January so enter Feb with $105k balance. Your stop is therefore 10% of $105k or $10.5k . If your account balance dips to $94.5k ($105k-$10.5k) then you stop yourself out and don\u2019t resume trading till March the first.\n\nHaving monthly calendar breaks is nice for another reason. Say you made a load of money in January. You don\u2019t want to start February feeling you are up 5% or it is too tempting to avoid trading all month and protect the existing win. Each month and each year should feel like a clean slate and an independent period.\u00a0\n\nEveryone has trading slumps. It is perfectly normal. It will definitely happen to you at some stage. The trick is to take a break and refocus. Conserve your capital by not trading a lot whilst you are on a losing streak. This period will be much harder for you emotionally and you\u2019ll end up making suboptimal decisions. An enforced break will help you see the bigger picture.\u00a0\n\nPut in place a process before you start trading and then it\u2019ll be easy to follow and will feel much less emotional. Remember: the market doesn\u2019t care if you win or lose, it is nothing personal.\n\nWhen your head has cooled and you feel calm you return the next month and begin the task of building back your account balance.\u00a0\n\n# That's a wrap on risk management\n\nThanks for taking time to read this three-part chapter on risk management. I hope you enjoyed it. Do comment in the replies if you have any questions or feedback.\n\nRemember: the most important part of trading is not making money. It is not losing money. Always start with that principle. I hope these three notes have provided some food for thought on how you might approach risk management and are of practical use to you when trading. Avoiding mistakes is not a sexy tagline but it is an effective and reliable way to improve results.\n\nNext up I will be writing about an exciting topic I think many traders should look at rather differently: news trading.

Don't let this kind of stuff get in your head- chances are you don't have the capital to move the markets. You're simply playing against yourself and should hold yourself accountable to your trading plan. Do ASRs each week and understand your mistakes. The market doesn't make you enter/exit too late or too early. The market doesn't make you use poor risk management. This is just an excuse too fall on when you lose. Yes the market is made up of these things but no they are not your competition.",
            "Some of the comments attempting to be encouraging here by disagreeing with the OP are actually doing beginners a great disservice.\n\nIf you want to live in your own bubble and pretend you're just playing a video game in isolation then have fun losing your money as slowly as possible.\n\nThe reality is that, especially in FX, your own broker is hoping you'll lose for their own gain. (If you don't know what a B Book is, you don't even know where your losses are going.)\n\nHaving worked for years on the other side of the fence (with brokerages, systems sellers, etc) the worst thing a retail FX trader can do is hold onto the belief that the only thing between you and profits is better psychology and more discipline.\n\nEvery book or course that sold you that crap was there to enrich the author and publisher, not you.\n\nReal edges in all markets are never shared (they'd use it to make money for themselves), let alone sold for amounts less than a year's poverty line income or given out for free on the internet.\n\nMost beginners are using a technical analysis based strategy that may have been cutting edge in 1920 but no longer as an edge over a coin toss because markets have moved on to far more sophisticated levels of math that are less attractive to teach beginners in ebooks and courses.\n\nA strategy without a real edge over a coin toss can't be turned profitable by any level of psychology, discipline, ritual, or other belief based crap. And if your strategy doesn't have a real edge to begin with, you're at best succeeding at shrinking your account more slowly with a few lucky retracements here and there that keep you encouraged enough to stay in and continue enriching B Book brokers, retail liquidity buyers, etc.\n\nFX is not zero sum in terms of one account vs another account, but it is in a more spread out sense. The dollars you lose are spread out between your broker (even A Book brokers in terms of commissions etc), liquidity providers, and more indirectly the major banks.\n\nReal edges still exist but they're not where the authors, courses, brokers, etc., want you to believe they are. It's in their interest to keep you believing in the lies and that's exactly why the OP is correct.\n\nYou're surrounded by wolves, don't be naive and fall for the narrative handed to you by wolves.\n\nIf you want to believe otherwise, go ahead and do harm to yourself but don't perpetuate the harmful beliefs to beginners who may already be struggling in the current economy.",

        "description": "A little background, 23 year old dude from Singapore with IT background (Ethical hacker), friend introduced me to Forex which he eventually quit but I didn't. I love challenges and now I plan on taking up Forex trading as a career apart from my passive income jobs.\n\nWhen I first started trading, I was frustrated! I had so many unanswered questions, why do I keep getting stopped out? Why are my profits so low? Why was my trades always going opposite only once I opened. Is my broker trading against me? So I paused and walked away from the charts for a few weeks, in that break I took it upon myself to understand more about Forex before opening the charts again and here is what I learned. Mind you, I did not buy any course or Indicators! All I did was read articles on the internet, watch a ton of YouTube videos and tried almost all indicators .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here we go, my tips. These are based on my views**\n\n1. UNDERSTAND BANKS AND BIG FINANCIALS INSTITUTIONS MOVES THE MARKET - No retail traders will be able to move the market like how the Big Banks move the market. You need to understand how banks move smart money and dumb money.(Will explain more later in the post)\n2. STOP SEARCHING FOR THE HOLY GRAIL - No indicators is going to tell you where is the best entry or best exit. They often lag and are behind time so by the time you enter a trade, the trend has already moved a certain percentage causing you to lose precious pips that you could have gotten as profits. Instead look at the charts to search for \"low risk, high probability trades\" (Will explain more later in the post)\n3. LOOK OUT FOR NEWS (fundamentals) - Big impact news move the markets with big moves, don't get stopped out because you entered at the wrong time without knowing that there is a high impact news in a few minutes/hours. It might hurt your account badly even through you have a stop-loss. Understand the nature of the news and  how it will impact the currency.\n4. DO NOT CHASE PROFITS - Chasing profits will be the number one reason you blow your account because no amount of money will satisfy you, you will always want more. Trust me, I've been there and done that . Instead start looking at percentage earned and loss, because in Forex you need money to make money. Lets say you have a target of 5% a month, with a $1000 account that is only $50 and doesn't seem significant but do that with a $100,000 account and you will get $5000 every month. I think you will get it by now. You can't just open a $1000 account and expect to be a millionaire in 1 month. Greed will take over you and you will blow every account you open.\n5. DO NOT OVER LEVERAGE YOU ACCOUNT - By over leveraging you will be able to open larger lot sizes and you will feel good that you can use less money to earn more profit! Then you will start trading, say you profited your first trade and you feel good about yourself. Profited your second trade and feel even better. So you go bigger in the third trade, and guess what? You lost this trade. And this one loss is enough to wipe out your whole $1000 account.\n6. MORE TRADES DOES NOT GIVE YOU MORE PROFITS - As a trader you should understand not every trade will turn out positive, there will always be negative trades. And at times you can have more negative trade than positive but still end up with profits at the end of the week? This is where quality over quantity trades comes in play. Lets say for example you had 4 losing trades and 2 winning trades, your losing trades are 2% each and your winning trades are 8% each, add them up and you will still have 8% profit. This is also a very important part called risk management. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND RISK MANAGEMENT ELSE YOU WILL ALWAYS FAIL IN FOREX.\n7. NEVER CHASE THE MARKET - Markets move 24/7 from Monday 5 AM to Saturday 5 AM (Singapore time, GMT+8). There will be plenty of opportunity to enter the market. You don't always need to have an open position during this time to feel like a trader. Smart traders look for the best opportunity to enter the market at certain levels. Missed an opportunity, don't worry! There will always be another opportunity, trust me!  By chasing the market and always trying to open a position, it will only cause you to blow out your account faster.\n8. PATIENCE PATIENCE PATIENCE - I can't place more emphasis on this point. Once you have analysed the market and placed your trade, be patient and let the market work for you. By you sitting at the screen 24/7, the trade is not going to go by your way magically. Remember Bulls will Profit, Bears will profit, only Pigs will get slaughtered! Don't let greed eat you alive.\n\n==================================================================================================\n\nNow lets talk about the \"low risk, high probability\" trades and how I trade. Trading is easy, if you take some time to understand it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow I trade? That's a simple question. I use supply and demand together with fundamentals. I keep my charts clean off indicators. I know I know as soon as I say supply and demand, some of you are going to be like supply and demand doesn't exist in the currency market. But I hope you understand this are my views.\n\n**Supply and Demand**\n\nSupply and demand levels are zones that tend to be tested again and again till its broken creating another level for supply and demand. You are basically trading against the trend and I know people will be scared and think I'm dumb for saying. But once I learned this theory and started practicing it, I kicked myself in the bum for being so dumb all this while. This zones are also known for when banks throw large amount of money into the market. Bank traders do not have their screen cluttered with tons of indicators like retail trades who is just in search for the holy grail. They practice supply and demand. Let me put it in a easier context, It is basically buying a currency at wholesale and selling it at a retail price. People always practice this everyday in life like buying more of a certain item just because it is on discount at a supermarket but I don't understand why they neglect it when it comes to Forex. It is no different here in the markets. I am not going to say no more, as I want you to google more about it and understand it yourself, that is the best way you will learn better. Watch YouTube videos, read articles, see how bankers trade, understand why they place the trade.\n\nAlso understand that there is no supply and demand in lower time frame like M1 or M5, its just noise. For myself, I use H1/H4/D1.\n\nI make 100-200 pips per week and that is enough for me currently, Remember don't be greedy.\n\nHowever when there is news events, supply and demand may be ignored due to the nature of how fundamentals affect the market differently. Understand the difference and with that I have came to the end.\n\nRemember to treat yourself once in awhile when you do good each month, You will enjoy trading better. Let me tell you the best part about trading, is that you can work from anywhere in the world, be your own boss and never be pressured by anyone.\n\nIf you have made it this far, I thank you for taking your time to read this thread. This may be your first step to success.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND AND HAPPY TRADING**\n\n==================================================================================================",

            "Wow great post!\n\nHow long have you been trading, how many trades in that time, and where is your equity balance right now?\n\nI miss Singapore. Great city. Great food. Miss my congee hawker stall.",
            "Here's my opinion, and I speak from experience. Both the positive and negative parts.\n\nYou've had an \"aha\" moment and had a string of a couple winning trades and/or a couple of losing trades that if you would have followed your trading plan better or noticed one other aspect, could have been a winning trade.\n\nYou understand the supply and demand concepts, from Youtube and articles, and can see on a chart where price appears to reflect. You understand why mathematically you should go for a higher R:R, but that concept is missing a factor to the equation, which is the % of 1:1 TP hits vs 3:1 or whatever R:R you decide.\n\nYou seem to have gathered a lot of information and have the intelligence to understand, regurgitate, and articulate that information in a well formatted document above. Which, by the way, I think is really well written and has some nuggets of solid advice. For the most part, this a summary of information you can gather from this reddit thread, most of which is so introductory level that it's not applicable to real trades. Good in theory, it makes sense, but you cannot \"make it\" with the info you've formatted above. I'm not saying you are wrong in what you've posted here, but it's also not all right. The hat tip is claiming that you've made it, as that makes you a target to be picked apart. You likely have done enough research on reddit and baby pips to think that saying you've been trading for a year and a half is enough \"demo time\" to be approved by this community. I remember telling people I've been trading profitably longer than I have in order to be taken more seriously. I'm sure I lot of people in this community have done that. You can still be taken seriously and add value and advice to your community before you have made it. If you are being honest with yourself, the \"year and a half of trading\" is probably all encompassing from the moment you heard the word forex to you the time you wrote this post, with failed strategy and discipline along the way, up until the past day, week, or maybe even month leading up to your \"aha\" moment.\n\nThere is no period of time or lot size you have to trade in order to have \"made it\", but the fact of the matter is that this post and the many others like it before and after it are all an attempt to simplify something extremely complex, maybe even in attempt to verbalize and work through your strategy and thought process. If it was simple thing to do, everyone would be making endless amounts of money.\n\nAs other traders have mentioned, it's hard to say you have made it until there is any real pressure on it. Are you a golfer? If not, I think you can atleast imagine the differences between hitting a bucket of balls on the driving range and playing for $2,000,000 with thousands of people crowded around you. Just because you can strike the ball well once or twice or even several times in the row doesn't mean you can do it consistently for 18 holes with any real money on the line. With that being said, its an accomplishment to have figured out how to do it on the driving range.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to you and you have the ability to consider what I'm trying to point out. I won't be surprised if you reply with a reason or some sort of screenshot proof of how you are profitable or really do make 100-200 pips a week, etc etc. However, I will be surprised if you can equate how close this hits home to the fact that I have been there and experienced it, and continue to work on your trading. When you've truly made it, you won't feel the need to summarize how or why in a reddit post.\n\nI want you to succeed. It starts by calling it how it is.",

I know what these so called successful traders say.

Ok, then congratulations, you now have a money printing machine (you don\u2019t). When you want to be honest with yourself, go through the same charts you back tested it on. Only this time specifically look for the same setups that ended in a reversal instead of a continuation.\n\nI want to be clear. Technical analysis isn\u2019t worthless. It helps you create (what\u2019s more like) guidelines (than actual rules! Arghhhh) that can make up a system that you can use. The problem is that new and old traders alike will see this and think they have valuable information when it\u2019s more than useless on its own. \n\nTell me you haven\u2019t been in the following situation: you see pattern you learnt about (flag, wedge, range, channel, double bottom, whatever). You enter the trade and you\u2019re already red, but it\u2019s just the spread and a couple ticks, no big deal. It moves against you some more and you start to question it. It goes against you some more, but you don\u2019t panic (much) because you realize that if you move your original trend line just a little you can accommodate the new price movement and it will still fit the pattern, giving you double confirmation that you are right. Well, you\u2019re not right. Only the market is right and it leaves you behind wondering what you did wrong. \n\nYou can accept or reject the fact that humans are susceptible to pareidolia.

The neutral POV here is that you need to be careful as failing 22 times to pass 1 time is indicative of having no real edge or plan in your approach.\n\n\"A broken clock is right twice a day\" I believe is the saying, and currently you are on 1/23, which makes you less accurate than a broken clock (potentially). Im sure this comment will be met with the usual \"dont listen to the haters\" type replies but in reality this comment will give you more to think about than pointless praise comments like the majority on this thread are.\n\nPeople like to pretend that once you have passed a funding challenge you have made it, when in reality probably the hardest part is keeping the account and extracting an income from it. Probability suggests that you will lose the account soon and be stuck in the cycle of doom of spamming evaluations. Take care and develop an actual edge before you undergo anymore of them please.\n\nBest of luck",

        "title": "Hi, here are some insights I learned over the last 7 years of forex trading.",
        "description": "Hi, I\u2019ve been a gambler- I mean\u2026 forex trader for 7 years now. I\u2019m an account manager for 2 prop firms, a MQL4/5 developer,  and have done some consulting for a couple minor forex education companies. Thought I\u2019d share some insights I wish I knew sooner. With how volatile the economy is and with inflation making it difficult to make ends meet, now more than ever I think forex can benefit the population. Disclaimer: I ain\u2019t the smartest guy. I have no formal education on forex. I\u2019m self taught and there\u2019s plenty of gaps in my knowledge. Take all of this with a grain of salt.\n\n**Insight #1:** When I was new to forex I traded as many pairs as possible. Learned all the correlations and indexes. I did not want to miss out on any trade opportunities. This resulted in me doing waaaaay more work than necessary. Today I only trade XAUUSD. It\u2019s all I need to turn a profit. I passed the prop firm evaluations only trading gold. Since it\u2019s all I trade, I\u2019m very familiar with it. I highly recommend choosing just 1-2 currency pairs and master them. Specifically, I recommend XAUUSD. Love it.\n\n**Insight #2:** Stop paying for broad general forex education. I gained more benefit from courses that focused purely on trading strategies rather than explaining what a pip is. \n\n**Insight #3:** It is very possible to \u201ccrack the code.\u201d I HIGHLY recommend learning MQL4/5. This is how I passed my first prop firm test. Even if you make a simple TP/SL bot or a script that sends you a mobile notification when certain market conditions are met, it\u2019ll make trading much easier. I was able to piece by piece convert my strategy into code. And now I honestly feel like I have the easiest job in the world because I have a bot that does the heavy lifting for me. There\u2019s lots of information on the internet about MQL4/5. \n\n**Insight #4:** Use MT4\u2019s strategy tester and or backtest AT LEAST 2 years of price data before going live. (I backtested 15 years of data before applying to the prop firms). Think you\u2019re onto something? Convert your strategy into code and backtest the last couple years. (Preferably more years than less). You\u2019ll learn really quick whether your strategy works or not. Or maybe it almost works and just needs some refinement. I wish I started doing this sooner. I didn\u2019t start doing this until year 6 of trading. In the last year I\u2019ve done more refinement than I have in all my previous years combined. You\u2019ll quickly find where the markets were most volatile. Those are the best times to backtest to see if your strategy works during those times. From my experience, if your strategy was profitable during the worst months, it\u2019ll be profitable for any month. Don\u2019t pay for MT4 price data, it\u2019s free if you just Google for it.\n\n**Insight #5:** It\u2019s okay to take breaks. After year 2 I quit for a year. Then came back, quit again for a few more months. I kept trying and failing a lot over a span of a few years. Around year 5 is when things changed for me. After awhile you know what works and more importantly, what does not work. \n\n**Insight #6:** Don\u2019t quit your day job/find a day job you like. I still coach kids 4 days a week even though financially I don\u2019t need it. Coaching kids was my job before forex. It\u2019s easy to become detached from humanity if all you do is forex. Go outside. Serve your community. Donate your money and time. It\u2019s good for your health. Feel free to disagree with me here, this is just my opinion.\n\n**Insight #7:** Don\u2019t strategy hop. Find a strategy that works for you and stick to it. I\u2019m guilty of buying a course on a new strategy, backtest ~3 months of it, get super hyped up, pay $1000 for a prop firm and fail because I combined the new strategy with previous strategies. If you want to combine strategies, backtest it first. If strategy 1 is 80% accurate and strategy 2 is 90% accurate, that doesn\u2019t mean together they are 85% accurate. If you combine them it will usually end up being less than 50% accurate. I don\u2019t have a mathematical explanation why, but this has been my experience. It\u2019s kinda hilarious when I think about it.\n\n**Insight #8:** I\u2019ve yet to find a free indicator that works. MA\u2019s and ADX have practical uses when combined with other variables. I use those two to measure market volatility. But I don\u2019t recommend going through all the free indicators on TradingView. I spent countless hours doing that. If someone develops an indicator that works, it won\u2019t be free. \n\n**Insight #9:** Even if you use an EA, it still requires technical analysis. Heck, my EA only works cause I\u2019m constantly adjusting its settings based on my technical analysis. So if you use an EA, don\u2019t expect it to be hands free.\n\n**Insight #10:** Less is more. Back when I traded purely manually without an EA, I had the best results when I only aimed to win 1 trade a day, 3 days a week. Find your threshold for over trading. My threshold was 1 trade. If I lost, I was done for the day. If I won, I was also done for the day. It makes things less stressful. \n\nIf I think of more insights I\u2019ll post them here. If you have any questions feel free to comment. There are no dumb questions. It\u2019s late here in California, I\u2019ll do my best to answer your questions tomorrow when I wake up. Hope this helps!\n\nMods, I think I followed all the rules. Please let me know if I need to modify my post.\n\nEdit 1: I\u2019ll go more in depth on my strategy in the morning. Almost 1am here in Cali, gonna get some rest.",

            "I have to disagree with #1. This is something very personal that doesn't work with all people. In my case I found out that sticking to one single pair makes me force entries where there aren't. Having multiple pairs in my watchlist gives me the chance to choose the best trade setup, instead being always chasing the entry in one single instrument",
            "I am not at the stage you are at. Around 1.5-2 years trading.\nAgree with all your insights. Like you i arrived at those insights myself the hard way.\n\nDeveloped my own indicators and EAs and still making more to help out .\nHands on is a must for me even with help of indicators. I don't expect full automation until a long time to come.\n\nBacktested until 1 year sadly but has been enough for now (I tend to get dizzy staring at charts for so long) .\n\nHave not break even yet the amount i lost since i started trading but have learnt a lot about my own psychology and how my mind thinks in different situations. Greed(setting too high tp), fear (closing trade too early) , over trading, impatient trading(jumping in trade too early) , too conservative trading when in drawdown, not being strict with my strategy when a good setup does not appear, getting distracted by signals and other instruments: have all been sins i have been guilty of. \n\nNot mixing different strategies is also something i learnt the hard way. \n\n1/2 trade a day 3 day a week is the magic number i also arrived at!! :) \n\n\nI tend to stop trading at 1-2% loss. \n\nAgree, trading feels very socially isolating. Specially on bad trading days, dont feel like socialising even more.  \nNeed to learn to balance somehow and avoid trading \nfrom influencing my social life. Any tips for that? \n\nCongratulations on getting so far and thanks for sharing.",
            "How to find strategies or make some ?  \nYoutube ? or just have to scroll through all the indicators and combine them and backtest or some other way ?  BTW amazing post, thanks a ton!",
            "Thank you for this post, a lot of this actually makes so much sense, I started trading just over 2 months ago, so I love hearing insights of other people, but one thing that a lot of people have been \u201ctelling\u201d me, and by telling , I mean seeing through the media platforms I research forex on is to just stick with one strategy, test it and if you like it and it works for you then good, use it and milk it. I have been over trading (at least it\u2019s on a demo) but I think I am going to cut down to 2 pairs, one thing that people have been \u201ctelling\u201d me. \n\n\nOne thing I really enjoyed though was your insight on helping people, one of my goals in terms of making a success out of forex and trading as a career, is to give. I live in South Africa, and all though I am very fortunate, I see poverty all around me every day. People begging on the streets, risking getting hit, just for a few rands, ( $1=R15 just about). I want to help the people in my country one day by maybe starting and education fund here in SA that can help younger people to find there passion and build the country through it. There is so much infrastructure and potential here but even more corruption, plans are set in place, but the plans are never carried out, but the people in parliament end up having nice house renovations or a Porsche\u2026 I digress\u2026 \n\nI am a firm believer in the idea that money doesn\u2019t change whole you are, it amplifies who you are, and I want to make it amplify my giving. Sure you can spend a lot of money on a mansion of a house or a new Ferrari, but, when you give out of the goodness and kindness of your own heart, that feeling is better than anything else in the world! \n\nOnce again, thank you so much for the insights, I hope to see some more content from you. I feel that as a beginner, the pest places to learn are from those who are where you want to be. As Jim Rhon says:\u201d Success leaves clues\u201d.",

            "Nice post. I earned it hard way. Was kinda cocky made 230% in one month now sitting on 50% (get it from 19% so 30% in one week is nice) \n\nEverything was good until i get insight 10 totally wrong. One day made 3% and talking \u201cthis is not enought\u201d then i eat one big fucking breakout, then emotions. And well\u2026 right now i am more focused and discipled to took 2-3 trades and call it a day",
            "Very nice post! Are there any special courses you have benefitted from related to point #2?",
            "Thanks OP. Which is your preferred Prop Firm?",
            "First of all \"i lile u dude\"! U seems to be a good man. Why i dont have a friend like u. Shit!\n\nOk now the actual comment to add up on ur insights. Im mql5 coder too and agree with all ur insights. Xauusd is amazing as u know that it will go up after going down a lot and it will also go down when the markets calms down after some panics that usually push it up a lot. \n\nI used to prefer xageur as it behave the same but with less inertia and thus more volatility. But metals are sometimes too sleepy for a long time and when it happens indexs have good volatility. That's why i suggest to trade simultaneously 1 metal 1 energy 1 forex and 1 indices, to hedge the risk and always having enough pips moving. But i strongly agree on choosing a portfolio and stick to it and observe it a lot, scroll it years in the past and study all the major peaks and check the news related to the date of those peaks to understand the dynamics. Only then the strstegies might be accurate. \n\n- so i suggest to pick 2 asset in metals (xageur and platinum for me)\n\n- 3 indexes: chinaA40, russel2000 and ustec for me. I used to like dax but im away of european stuff now. \n\n- 2 energy: xngusd and brent for me\nAnd forex i pick the pairs im able to follow their central banks news. AUDUSD and usdjpy are my favs. \n\n- I use DXY index to analyze any forex pair in order to know if the pair moved because of the usd or because of the \"other currency\". By the way, im on  some r&d to use the price action and sr levels of a correlated asset as indicator for a given asset. \n\n- i backtest and fine tune my strategies in a way that they may survive covid crash. And then i have an \"automaic lot sizing\" feature in my EA that calculates (according to covid crash and the drawdown from the latest ath) how many pips the market can go against me in a worst case scenario, then give me the perfect lot size taking in consideration that number and my free margin.   \nThis enables me to NEVER use a stop loss and  my positions can sustain the market going against me and waiting for it to come back my way. \nOf course it hsppens that i manually close positions if the ea opened a position based on hypothesis thst ended up to be wrong (happened after covid where some assets were expected to go in a direction then Ukraine war sent them in the other direction). So sometimes the trader must accept that his strategy is no longrr a good one, things may have evolved. \n\nOnly indicators i use are multiple rsi 5, 14, 22 periods thx to mql5) and linear regression to enable my code to \"see\" the trend direction, (it mimics zigzags indicator removing the noise). \n\nIn manual trading i LOVE to play with Andrew pitchfork, this gem is so u derrated and hard to use for 80% of ppl. But provide amazing future forecasts. \nElliot waves are cool, but first i wanna code an ea that trades them to verify how that YouTube guy was wronf \ud83d\ude1d\nI only trade 1:500 leverage. So no place for emotions, that's why i let my EA do the job. \n\n1 more advice : WITHDRAW profits or it gets wiped in a way or another. \n\nI still have 10+ ideas i wanna code but my real job takes lot of time (im a web and mobile developer) so put trading on hold for now. Especially that things may brutally change anytime (pandemic cryptos and fed made all the prices very far from their intrinsic value, so i feel in my gut that some kind of economical RESET is on its way to fix the bias. \nThat's for now. \nCheers dude.",

This is because I am finding it hard to do my day job and forex at the same time.\n\nPlease advise",
            "I had my fair share of learning about Forex thru a friend, who got me on IML academy. I was failing terribly at recruiting people I hadn't talked to for years but something in me felt strongly about this trading shit\n\nIt was a friend who bought 4 tickets to the Dallas, Texas convention. I have to admit I was hyped and impressed, the biggest crowd I've seen and all walks of life. That was so convincing. Bob proctor was there, although i have to admit i didnt have a damn clue who he was. But the idea that these thousands of humans gathering to learn about forex.. idk i learned quick that these pyramid scheme or multilevel marketing was NOT for me\n\nBut i found babypips.com\nIts entirely free but really now its all on self. Which i think this trading shit is, to really educate urself on a super deep level\n\nI left dallas now seeing how much trading is about psychology/ emotions\n\nI was dealing with homelessness during covid. Amongst other things. I depended on a total stranger for shelter, by the 4th month he started expressing anger/violence. Kinda held hostage or threatened me with fear and physical objects like my pepper spray. When i escaped, i had to run out and left my 2 cats behind. He murdered them both and sent me texts of rage and voicemail. I was bruised on temples and  all around my face. Spent 6 hrs at police station filing report. \n\nIdk ive been fuckin self recovering. I did therapy for a while but hate it\n Ive always been a private person ish\n I hate the possibility of someone sharing my business so i stopped. \n\nIm a fuckin a mess, a rare breed indeed.\n\nAnyway these days i have two diff jobs to keep me busy but livin check to check off min wages .. is driving me crazy cus i had previous jobs where i made good cash to take home at the end of the day, not wait two weeks.\n\nIdk\n\nI guess im asking for company\n_for advice\nHow to get motivation\n\nWhat do you do for yourself wen youve experienced something awful.. and very traumatic\n\nDefinitely on and off with forex but i try my best to stay consistent and capitalize wen im feelin at best. Rest when im feelin low\n\nAlso bc im super self taught, i kinda give up on trusting or paying people. To truly learn and get the most, i believe u gotta juice ur own lemons. And i keep reminding myself lifes bout the journey not destination\n\nWhat are some books or sites youve used",

The only people who I have seen manage to focus on one pair are mainly scalpers who focus on the 15min to maximum 4hr timeframe since their setup will always form.",

            "For those who have no clue what they are reading:\n\nIt's basically saying \"once you find a set of rules that work, stick to them, even if they are not always successful. A good trade is a trade that follows your rules. A bad trade is one that doesn't, even if it happened to be a winner, the risk-reward ratio probably wasn't worth it\".",

            "This is so true. \nI usually place about 40 good trades and let the probability play out then evaluate my profit from there.",
            "My take away was that a \"good\" trade is not inherently a win or loss, in the context of a reliable strategy. And that your focus should be on sticking to the rules of your system. Bearing in mind, everyone has to develop their own; it's always going to be yours specifically. And that's a lot of The Playbook.\nWhile individually the trade may go into profit or not isn't all that determine if it's good or bad. I think the point he was trying to make is that it has to be within the rules of your specific strategy, with proper setup, stop loss, take profits, etc., That the primary focus is on a Good Trade, not merely the results in a singularity.\nFor x number of good trades, assuming reasonable sample size, you will profit.\nFor the same number of poor trades, the results are uncertain, but 95% lose.\n\nThat was my take away from the book. Between Bellafiore and Douglas, there is a lot a new trader can learn to correct poor behaviors and improve. Especially if you're a scalper, although more of the technical points in the book apply to stocks an indices.",
