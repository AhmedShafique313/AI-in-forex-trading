# Artificial Intelligence based forex trading project (AI trading bot)
This is client based project, client from Malaysia and he asked me to use AI in forex trading to predict future prices by using `hundred thousands` of `indicators`. Client information is not provided in this repository. This repository will be `private` on completion of the project.

# Models and Predictions🔮
There are many machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence models and transformers are used in this project to predict future prices of forex trading market with high value of accuracy
### 1. Simple Linear Regression Model
This model is applied on the numeric dataset containing 5 features. The dataset is related to the 4-hour EURUSD. The feature `close` is on y-asix and features `open, low, high, volume` are on x-asix. 
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Dataset: 28000+
  
This model is best fit for this dataset and it is used as channel in forex trading software to check the prediction of the linear regression model on the base of historical datasets.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression Model
This model is applied on the numeric dataset containing 5 features. The dataset is related to the 1-day EURUSD. The feature `close` is on y-asix and features `open, low, high, volume` are on x-asix.
- Accuracy: 0.99
- Dataset: 68000+

However there is an overfitting in this model, also this model fails to show best fit on the graph. However multiple linear regression is more complex then linear regrssion model but it fails😢 to predict and it requires more data then I provided. 
However, linear regression also fit on the graph as well.
